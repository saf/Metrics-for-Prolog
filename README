Metrics for Prolog (MFPL) is a simple tool for measuring some
complexity metrics for Prolog programs.


== Dependencies ==

To be run, MFPL requires the following programs and packages:

* perl
* graphviz
* SWI-Prolog
* Perl packages (available from CPAN):
   -- XML::Simple, 
   -- GraphViz

== Running ==

To run the program, cd into its main directory and run:

   $ ./run.pl <pl-files>

where <pl-files> is a space-separated list of .pl Prolog files 
to be analysed.

== Documentation ==

In the main directory there is also a file metrics.tex, which 
contains an article on some assumptions I made while implementing
MFPL. The file may be compiled with the following command:

   $ pdflatex metrics.tex

after which the file metrics.pdf will be created, ready to be viewed.
